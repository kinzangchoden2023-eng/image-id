                <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> - In the Bhutan Baccalaureate, mentorship is central. All teachers serve as mentors, building trust-based, reciprocal relationships with their mentees. Mentors guide students in personal and academic growth while also learning from them. Regular sessions support consistent interaction and help create a community where both mentors and mentees work together toward shared goals.</li>
